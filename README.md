# IDEALS

This is the Ruby on Rails web application component of IDEALS, the Illinois
Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship, which publishes
research and scholarship from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

This is a getting-started guide for developers.

# Quick Links

* [JIRA Project](https://bugs.library.illinois.edu/projects/IR)

# Dependencies

* PostgreSQL >= 9.x
* Elasticsearch >= 7.x with the
  [ICU analysis plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/analysis-icu.html)
  installed
* An S3 endpoint, such as AWS S3 or [Minio Server](https://min.io)
* A Handle.net server. (See the
  [SCARS wiki](https://wiki.illinois.edu/wiki/display/scrs/Setting+Up+the+Handle.net+Software+Locally)
  for setup instructions.)
* RabbitMQ
* VIPS

(This stuff is all up and running in docker-compose; see the testing section.)

# Installation

## Install everything

```sh
# Install rbenv
$ brew install rbenv
$ brew install ruby-build
$ brew install rbenv-gemset --HEAD
$ rbenv init
$ rbenv rehash

# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/medusa-project/ideals.git
$ cd ideals

# Install Ruby into rbenv
$ rbenv install "$(< .ruby-version)"

# Install Bundler
$ gem install bundler

# Install application gems
$ bundle install
```

## Configure the application

```sh
$ cd config/credentials
$ cp template.yml development.yml
$ cp template.yml test.yml
```
Edit both as necessary.

## Create the Elasticsearch indexes

```sh
rails "elasticsearch:indexes:create[ideals_development]"
rails "elasticsearch:indexes:create[ideals_test]"
```
Note: the index schema may change from time to time. Index schemas can't
generally be changed in place, so a new index has to be created with the new
schema, and then either existing documents migrated into it, or new documents
loaded into it. For the development index, you may prefer to have separate
"blue" and "green" indexes and to switch back-and-forth between them as needed:

```sh
rails "elasticsearch:indexes:create[ideals_blue_development]"
rails "elasticsearch:indexes:create_alias[ideals_blue_development,ideals_development]"
```
Then when you need to create a new index, you can switch to the "green" one and
delete the blue one:

```sh
rails "elasticsearch:indexes:create[ideals_green_development]"
rails "elasticsearch:indexes:copy[ideals_blue_development,ideals_green_development]"
rails "elasticsearch:indexes:delete_alias[ideals_blue_development,ideals_development]"
rails "elasticsearch:indexes:create_alias[ideals_green_development,ideals_development]"
rails "elasticsearch:indexes:delete[ideals_blue_development]"
```
(Instead of using aliases, you could also change the `elasticsearch/index` key
in your `development.yml`.)

Note 2: the above does not apply to the test index. This index will be
recreated automatically when the tests are run.

## Configure RabbitMQ

```sh
$ brew install rabbitmq
$ brew services start rabbitmq
# Add /usr/local/sbin to $PATH
$ rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management

# Add yourself as an admin user and grant permissions to yourself
$ rabbitmqctl add_user <username> <password>
$ rabbitmqctl set_user_tags <username> administrator
$ rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / <username> '.*' '.*' '.*'
```
Open the management interface at http://localhost:15672.
Log in using the credentials you just created
In the Queues tab, in the "Add a new queue" section, add two queues named
`ideals_to_medusa` `medusa_to_ideals`, both with default properties.
Then restart RabbitMQ:
```sh
$ brew services restart rabbitmq
```

## Configure the Handle.net server

Refer to the instructions in the
[SCARS wiki](https://wiki.illinois.edu/wiki/display/scrs/Setting+Up+the+Handle.net+Software+Locally).

## Migrate content from IDEALS-DSpace into the application

The migration process requires dropping the existing database and starting over
with a new one. A prerequisite is a dump of the IDEALS-DSpace database loaded
into a PostgreSQL instance and named `dbname`.

The migration process is divided into two steps. The first step migrates
critical data--the core entities needed to make the application usable. It
should be possible to deploy to production with only this data intact.

The second step migrates non-critical data like statistics, which may take a
lot longer than the first step. This step does not have to be done on a fresh
database.

### In development

```sh
rails elasticsearch:purge
rails db:reset
rails "ideals_dspace:migrate_critical[dbname,dbhost,dbuser,dbpass]"
rails ideals:seed
rails elasticsearch:reindex[2] # thread count
rails handles:put_all
rails "ideals_dspace:migrate_non_critical[dbname,dbhost,dbuser,dbpass]" # optional
```
N.B.: (`dbhost` etc.) are only required if the database is on a different host
and/or the database user is different from the default.

### In production

```sh
~/bin/stop-rails
rails medusa:delete_all_bitstreams
rails elasticsearch:purge
rails db:reset
rails "ideals_dspace:migrate_critical[dbname,dbhost,dbuser,dbpass]"
rails ideals:seed
rails elasticsearch:reindex[2] # thread count
rails handles:put_all
# This user must authorize your SSH key for passwordless login
rails "ideals_dspace:bitstreams:copy_into_medusa[ideals_dspace_ssh_user]"
rails "ideals_dspace:migrate_non_critical[dbname,dbhost,dbuser,dbpass]"
```

## Create a user account

There are two main categories of accounts: local identity, where account
information is stored locally in the database, and Shibboleth, where account
info is provided by a Shibboleth SP. There are rake tasks to create sysadmins
of both types:

```sh
rails "ideals:users:create_local_sysadmin[email,password]"
rails "ideals:users:create_shib_sysadmin[netid]"
```

## Run the web app

```sh
$ rails server
```

# Multi-Tenancy

When a request is made to the web app through a reverse proxy server (which is
always expected to be the case in the demo and production environments), the
proxy supplies an `X-Forwarded-Host` header that conveys the fully-qualified
domain name (FQDN) via which the app was accessed. The `current_institution()`
method of `ApplicationController` (and `ApplicationHelper`) returns the
Institution model associated with this FQDN in order to tailor the
functionality to a particular institution.

In other environments, multi-tenancy can be tested by adding some lines to
`/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1 ideals-host1.local
127.0.0.1 ideals-host2.local
# this is only used for testing data imported from "old IDEALS"
127.0.0.1 ideals-uiuc.local
```

(See also the `config.hosts` key in the `config/environments/*.rb` files.)

Then, you can access http://ideals-host1:3000 and http://ideals-host2:3000 in
order to play around with multi-tenancy.


# Branches & Environments

| Rails Environment | Git Branch                 | Machine                | Configuration File                       |
|-------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `development`     | any (usually `develop`)    | Local                  | `config/credentials/development.yml`     |
| `test`            | any                        | Local & GitHub Actions | `config/credentials/test.yml` & `ci.yml` |
| `demo`            | `demo`                     | aws-ideals-demo        | `config/credentials/demo.yml.enc`        |
| `production`      | `production`               | aws-ideals-production  | `config/credentials/production.yml.enc`  |

Files that end in `.enc` are encrypted. Obtain the encryption key for the
corresponding file and then use `rails credentials:edit -e <environment>` to
edit it.

`config/credentials/template.yml` contains the canonical configuration
structure that all config files must use.

`config/credentials/ci.yml` is copied to `test.yml` in continuous integration
(see below).

See the class documentation in `app/config/configuration.rb` for a detailed
explanation of how the configuration system works.

# Documentation

Code documentation uses YARD/Markdown syntax. The `rails doc:generate` command
invokes YARD to generate HTML documentation for the code base.

# Tests & Continuous Integration

Minitest is used for model and controller tests. `rails test` runs the tests.

Tests may depend on any or all of the dependent services (Elasticsearch,
RabbitMQ, etc.). It's perfectly legitimate to install all of that stuff on your
local machine and run the tests there. You can also use `docker-compose`, which
will initialize a container, copy the code base into it, spin up all of the
service containers, and run the tests:

```sh
$ docker-compose up --build --exit-code-from ideals
```

This is how tests are run in continuous integration, which uses
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
