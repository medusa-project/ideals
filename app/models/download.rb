##
# Represents a file download.
#
# This model is part of a system that can be used for downloads that may take
# a non-trivial amount of time to prepare. A typical workflow is:
#
# 1. The user clicks a download button.
# 2. The responding controller creates a [Download] instance, invokes an
#    asynchronous job to prepare the file for download, and redirects to the
#    instance's URL.
# 3. The job associates the Download with a [Task], which enables progress
#    reporting.
# 4. The job does its work, periodically updating the {Task#percent_complete}
#    attribute to keep the user informed. When done, it sets {filename} to the
#    file's filename, and sets {Task#status} to {Task::Status::SUCCEEDED}.
# 5. The page reloads automatically via XHR, and now contains a link which the
#    user follows to download the file.
#
# Periodically, old [Download] records and their corresponding files should be
# cleaned up using the `downloads:cleanup` rake task. This will mark them as
# expired and delete their corresponding files. Expired instances are kept
# around for record keeping.
#
# # Storage
#
# Downloads are stored in the application S3 bucket under the
# `institutions/:key/downloads/` key prefix.
#
# # Attributes
#
# * `created_at`     Managed by ActiveRecord.
# * `expired`        When a download is expired, it is no longer usable and its
#                    associated file is no longer available. Client code should
#                    call {expire} rather than setting this directly.
# * `filename`       Filename of the file to be downloaded. ({url} can be used
#                    instead.
# * `key`            Random alphanumeric "public ID." Should be hard to guess
#                    so that someone can't access someone else's download.
# * `institution_id` Foreign key to [Institution].
# * `task_id`        Foreign key to [Task].
# * `updated_at`     Managed by ActiveRecord.
# * `url`            URL to redirect to rather than downloading a local file.
#                    Must be publicly accessible.
