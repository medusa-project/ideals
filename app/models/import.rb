# frozen_string_literal: true

##
# Represents a batch import of {Item}s, such as via {CsvImporter} or
# {SafImporter}.
#
# See the documentation of {ImportsController} for an explanation of how
# importing works.
#
# # Attributes
#
# * `collection_id`  ID of the {Collection} into which new items are to be
#                    imported.
# * `created_at`     Managed by ActiveRecord.
# * `filename`       Name of the file to import.
# * `format`         One of the {Import::Format} constant values. This may be
#                    null in the case of a newly created instance to which
#                    files have not been uploaded yet.
# * `imported_items` JSON array of objects with `item_id` and `handle` keys.
#                    This is analogous to the contents of a mapfile (see
#                    {SafImporter}) and can be used to reconstruct one.
# * `institution_id` Foreign key to {Institution} representing the institution
#                    into which items are being imported.
# * `length`         Length of the file identified by {filename}.
# * `task_id`        Sort foreign key to {Task} which can be used for status
#                    reports--soft because imports and tasks may be updated
#                    within separate database connections.
# * `updated_at`     Managed by ActiveRecord.
# * `user_id`        ID of the {User} who initiated the import.
