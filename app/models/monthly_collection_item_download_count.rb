##
# This is a reporting model/table that enables more efficient queries for
# monthly item download counts within collections than the alternative, which
# would be to query the `events` table and sum the counts of each download
# event (like {Collection#download_count_by_month} does).
#
# The data in this table is derived from that in `monthly_item_download_counts`
# using {compile_counts}. So, that table must be populated first. See
# [MonthlyItemDownloadCount] for more information.
#
# Attributes
#
# * `collection_id`  Soft foreign key to [Collection].
# * `count`          Download count.
# * `created_at`     Managed by ActiveRecord.
# * `month`          Month number from 1 to 12.
# * `updated_at`     Managed by ActiveRecord.
# * `year`           Year.
