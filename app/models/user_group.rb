# Aggregation of {LocalUser}s, {AdGroup}s, and other dimensions, for the
# purpose of performing group-based authorization.
#
# User groups can be global or scoped to an institution. Global groups can only
# be created or edited by system administrators.
#
# User groups have human-readable {#name names}. They also have a {#key} that
# is unique within the same scope. The key is generally used only within the
# application to get a handle on certain {#SYSTEM_REQUIRED_GROUPS
# system-required groups}. For those groups, it is fixed and known. For other
# groups, like whatever arbitrary groups are created within an institution, it
# is auto-filled with a random string.
#
# When an {Institution} is created, a group that represents it is created along
# with it. This group is considered to {UserGroup#defines_institution define
# the institution}.
#
# # Attributes
#
# * `created_at`          Managed by ActiveRecord.
# * `defines_institution` Whether the group defines the users in its owning
#                         institution. Every institution should have one such
#                         group.
# * `institution_id`      Foreign key to {Institution} indicating that the
#                         group is exclusive to that institution. May also be
#                         `nil`, indicating that the group is global, available
#                         to all institutions.
# * `key`                 Short string identifier that is unique within an
#                         institutional scope. This is generally used only
#                         within the application to get a handle on certain
#                         {#SYSTEM_REQUIRED_GROUPS system-required groups}.
# * `name`                Arbitrary human-readable name that is unique within
#                         an institutional scope.
# * `updated_at`          Managed by ActiveRecord.
