##
# This is a reporting model/table that enables more efficient queries for
# monthly item download counts than the alternative, which would be to query
# the `events` table and sum the counts of each download event (like
# {Item#download_count_by_month} does).
#
# After every month, a batch process is run (typically the
# `downloads:compile_monthly_counts` rake task via cron) which invokes
# {compile_counts}) to populate the table with download counts from that month
# and any earlier months that don't yet have counts. Note that the current
# month is not included, because it is still accumulating downloads. A current
# month count can be obtained from {Item#download_count_by_month}. {for_item}
# will also invoke that method to include the current month's count as a
# convenience.
#
# Attributes
#
# N.B.: the "soft" foreign keys are not real foreign keys because a row
# represents a month in the past. If `item_id` were a real foreign key, then
# deleting an item would delete all of its historical counts, and reduce those
# of its owning collection, unit, and institution.
#
# * `collection_id`  Soft foreign key to the primary collection of the
#                    [Item].
# * `count`          Download count.
# * `created_at`     Managed by ActiveRecord.
# * `institution_id` Soft foreign key to the institution of the primary
#                    unit of the primary collection of the [Item].
# * `item_id`        Soft foreign key to [Item].
# * `month`          Month number from 1 to 12.
# * `unit_id`        Soft foreign key to the primary unit of the primary
#                    collection of the [Item].
# * `updated_at`     Managed by ActiveRecord.
# * `year`           Year.
