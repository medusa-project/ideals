##
# This is a reporting model/table that enables more efficient queries for
# monthly item download counts within units than the alternative, which would
# be to query the `events` table and sum the counts of each download event
# (like {Unit#download_count_by_month} does).
#
# The data in this table is derived from that in `monthly_item_download_counts`
# using {compile_counts}. So, that table must be populated first. See
# {MonthlyItemDownloadCount} for more information.
#
# Attributes
#
# * `count`      Download count.
# * `created_at` Managed by ActiveRecord.
# * `month`      Month number from 1 to 12.
# * `unit_id`    Soft foreign key to the {Unit}.
# * `updated_at` Managed by ActiveRecord.
# * `year`       Year.
