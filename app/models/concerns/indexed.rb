##
# Concern to be included by models that get indexed in OpenSearch. Provides
# almost all of the functionality they need except for {as_indexed_json}, which
# must be overridden.
#
# # What gets indexed?
#
# Any entity that will appear in results that:
#
# 1. Are faceted
# 2. Are natural- or relevance-sorted
# 3. Are field-weighted
# 4. Require fine-grained control over query processing
# 5. Would require a complicated/impossible SQL query
# 6. Need better performance than the database can provide
#
# **All** models of a particular class get indexed, including buried ones,
# embargoed ones, etc.
#
# # Querying
#
# A low-level interface to OpenSearch is provided by {OpenSearchClient},
# but in most cases, it's easier to use the higher-level query interface
# provided by the various {AbstractRelation} subclasses.
#
# # Persistence callbacks
#
# Documents are automatically submitted to OpenSearch (see
# {as_indexed_json}) upon transaction commit. They are **not** sent upon save
# or destroy. Whenever creating, updating, or deleting outside of a
# transaction, you must {reindex reindex} or {delete_document delete} the
# document manually. (If you make a mistake here, you can use {index_unindexed}
# to rectify it.)
#
# This behavior has implications for batch processing. When updating large
# numbers of indexed models, it is common to use a technique like
# {ActiveRecord::Base#find_each} to iterate over them in batches, wrapping that
# in an {ActiveRecord::Base#uncached} block. Transactions will disable the
# latter block and defeat the memory efficiency of the former block by causing
# all loaded instances to get cached in memory. Transactions, therefore, tend
# to be a bad idea when batch-processing.
#
# # How OpenSearch interaction works in the application
#
# There are two layers of OpenSearch interaction:
#
# 1. {OpenSearchClient} handles all of the HTTP communication. Although this
#    alone would be enough to communicate with OpenSearch, the queries that
#    are needed tend to be quite complex, so another layer exists to help with
#    that:
# 2. {AbstractRelation} subclasses enable query construction and results
#    marshaling in the manner of {ActiveRecord::Relation} on model objects
#    that include this module. They use {OpenSearchClient} behind the
#    scenes.
#
# # Author's note
#
# Why is a custom client solution used instead of the official Elastic Ruby
# gems? This application needs fine-grained control over searching, and I am
# worried about obscuring the communication between it and OpenSearch behind
# a complicated and perhaps poorly documented & supported glue layer. This
# system also provides a nicer interface to ES than Elastic's gems, which
# require clients to understand ES concepts to construct their queries, which
# are hardly trivial. Also, this application is hosted in AWS, which has
# recently forked ES into its own OpenSearch product, which is not guaranteed
# to remain compatible with Elastic's gems. Although AWS publishes its own SDK
# for OpenSearch, all of the same concerns apply.
