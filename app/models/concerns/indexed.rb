# Concern to be included by models that get indexed in Elasticsearch. Provides
# almost all of the functionality they need except for {as_indexed_json}, which
# must be overridden.
#
# # Querying
#
# A low-level interface to Elasticsearch is provided by {ElasticsearchClient},
# but in most cases, it's better to use the higher-level query interface
# provided by the various {AbstractRelation} subclasses, which are easier to
# use, and take public accessibility etc. into account.
#
# # Persistence Callbacks
#
# **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Instances are automatically indexed in Elasticsearch (see
# {as_indexed_json}) upon transaction commit. They are **not** indexed on
# save or destroy. Whenever creating, updating, or deleting outside of a
# transaction, you must {reindex reindex} or {delete_document delete} the
# document manually.
