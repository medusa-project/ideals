# Non-NetID user who has either been invited to register, or has requested to
# register, and may or may not yet have a corresponding {LocalIdentity
# identity}.
#
# # Invitation/Registration Flow
#
# This class is the entry point into the local-user account model. Instances
# are created in response to two events:
#
# 1. A sysadmin invites a user to register. In this case, a sysadmin fills an
#    email address into a private form. This creates an instance that is pre-
#    {ApprovalState#APPROVED approved} to register. An email is sent to that
#    address containing a link to the registration form. The link includes a
#    `token` query argument containing a value that authorizes access to the
#    form.
# 2. A user requests to register. In this case, the user fills their email
#    address and a purpose statement into form and submits it. The user
#    receives an email confirmation of the request. Sysadmins also receive
#    emails notifying them that action is required (either approval or
#    rejection) on the user's request to register.
#     a. If approved, the user receives an email telling them such and a link
#        to the registration form, as in (1). The {Invitee} instance is marked
#        as {ApprovalState::APPROVED approved}.
#     b. If rejected, the user receives an email telling them such and the
#        {Invitee} instance is marked as {ApprovalState::REJECTED rejected}.
# 3. At this point, assuming the user is approved, the "paths" merge. The user
#    accesses the registration form, filling in their info.
# 4. Upon successful form submission, the user receives a welcome email.
#
# # Attributes
#
# * `approval_state`    One of the {ApprovalState} constant values.
# * `created_at`        Managed by ActiveRecord.
# * `email`             Email address.
# * `expires_at`        Time after which invite is no longer valid.
# * `institution_admin` If true, signifies that the corresponding {User} that
#                       is to be created should be an administrator of the
#                       institution referenced by {institution_id}.
# * `institution_id`    Foreign key to {Institution} signifying the institution
#                       into which the invitee is being invited.
# * `inviting_user_id`  Foreign key to {User} indicating the user who invited
#                       the invitee to register. This is null in the case of
#                       "self-invited" invitees.
# * `note`              Contains the "purpose" that the user entered when
#                       requesting an account. For users who were invited and
#                       did not request their account, this is autofilled with
#                       such a notice.
# * `rejection_reason`  Contains the reason entered by an administrator who has
#                       rejected the invitee.
# * `updated_at`        Managed by ActiveRecord.
