##
# # How styles work in the application
#
# This is a Sprockets-based app. There is a Bootstrap gem specified in the
# Gemfile and the stylesheet from that is imported into the `application.scss`.
# There are some other global, non-institution-specific style overrides in the
# same folder.
#
# Institution-specific styles are handled differently: an institution can
# configure custom link colors etc. via the UI, which are injected into a
# custom stylesheet provided by this controller. This gets overlaid onto the
# base Bootstrap+global custom styles mentioned above.
#
# This controller is only used in scoped context, not global.
#
class StylesheetsController < ApplicationController

  # Responds to `GET /custom-styles`, returning CSS.
