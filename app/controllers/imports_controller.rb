##
# # How imports work
#
# 1. Before any uploading happens, the client creates an {Import} instance
#    representing the import, which is associated with a {Collection} into
#    which files are to be imported.
# 2. In the UI, there is a file input accepting either a compressed file (for
#    packages) or a CSV file. When the input receives a file:
#      1. An XHR PATCH request is made to {update} containing its name and
#         length.
#      2. An XHR GET request is made to {show}. The response contains a JSON
#         representation of the {Import}, which contains a presigned S3 URL to
#         upload to.
#      3. The client uploads the file to this URL.
#      4. When the upload is complete, the client invokes {complete_upload},
#         which invokes an {ImportJob} to work asynchronously.
#      5. After the import has finished (successfully or not), the import
#         package is deleted.
