# # How imports work
#
# Before any uploading happens, a new {Import} instance is created representing
# the import. The import is associated with a {Collection} into which files
# are being imported.
#
# In the UI, there is a file upload "drop zone" into which either a compressed
# file (for packages) or a CSV file can be dropped. {upload_file} receives the
# file and stores it on the file system.
#
# After all files have been uploaded, {complete} is called which invokes an
# {ImportJob} to work asynchronously on the import using whatever importer it
# deems necessary (e.g. {CsvImporter}, {SafImporter}, etc.)
#
# After the import has succeeded, the import package is deleted.
#
