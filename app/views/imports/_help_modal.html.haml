        %h3 CSV Format
        %hr

        %h4 Header Row
        %p
          The header row defines the metadata values contained in succeeding rows.
          The first column, <code>id</code>, refers to an item's internal
          database ID. Remaining columns contain the names of elements in the
          element registry. Every element name in the header row must be unique.

        %h4 Non-Header Rows
        %p
          Each non-header row corresponds to a particular item. The first cell
          contains either a database ID (for items that already
          exist), or a plus sign (<code>+</code>) for new items to be created.
          Each remaining cell specifies a metadata element value. Multiple
          values for the same element can be separated with a double pipe (<code>||</code>).

        %h4 Element Processing
        %p
          During an import, the item metadata for the item/element combination represented by
          each cell is changed to reflect the contents of the CSV. Note that this means
          that if there are multiple values for a given element in the same cell (separated by a
          double pipe) and a change is only needed for some of the values, the
          unchanged values must still appear in the cell, or else they will be deleted.
        %p
          Leaving a cell empty will cause that item's corresponding element to be deleted.
        %p
          If an element does not appear as a column in the CSV, the values of that
          element are ignored and are unaffected by the importing process.

        %h3 SAF Format
        %hr
        %p SAF is a DSpace package format containing a batch of things to import.

        %h4 Package Structure
        %p
          At the root of a SAF package is a directory known as the "archive directory."
          Each subdirectory within it represents a particular item.
          Each item directory contains a file named <code>content</code>, which is a manifest of
          files that compose the item. These files are all present in the item
          directory. The format of the content file is described below.

        %p
          The item directory also contains an XML file that encodes the item's
          metadata.

        %h4 Content File Format

        %p
          The content file is a plain text file containing a newline-separated list
          of files associated with an item. A filename may optionally be followed by
          any combination of the following (where <code>\t</code> is a tab character):

        %dl
          %dt
            %code \tbundle:BUNDLENAME
          %dd
            The name of the bundle to which the bitstream should be added. Without
            specifying the bundle, items will go into the default "content" bundle.
          %dt
            %code \tdescription:DESCRIPTION
          %dd
            Text of the file's description.
          %dt
            %code \tprimary:true
          %dd
            Specifies the primary bitstream.

        %h4 Metadata File Format

        %p
          DSpace was created with qualified Dublin Core in mind, so at a minimum there
          exists one file named <code>dublin_core.xml</code>, which contains a form like:

        %pre
          %code
            &lt;dublin_core&gt;
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dcvalue element="title" qualifier="none"&gt;A Tale of Two Cities&lt;/dcvalue&gt;
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dcvalue element="date" qualifier="issued"&gt;1990&lt;/dcvalue&gt;
            &lt;/dublin_core&gt;

        %p
          There is no schema validation, but it keeps this basic structure. This would
          create values for the elements <code>dc:title</code> (if qualifier is
          <code>none</code> then the qualifier is simply omitted) and
          <code>dc:date:issued</code>. In this default file the schema prefix
          will always be <code>dc</code>.

        %p
          For each additional schema, a file named like <code>metadata_{prefix}.xml</code>
          exists. Even though the schema may not be related to Dublin Core, the XML is
          formatted identically to <code>dublin_core.xml</code> with the exception that
          the root element receives an attribute that identifies the schema prefix.

        %h4 Error Recovery
        %p
          Any error encountered during the import will terminate the import. As each
          item is imported, it is written to a "mapfile" which is a plain text file in
          the following format:

        %p
          %code {directory_name}\t{item_handle}

        %p
          (With <code>\t</code> representing the tab character and the directory name being the
          name of the directory in the SAF package representing the new item.) When the
          import is re-run, any items already present in the mapfile are skipped.
