%h1 Welcome to IDEALS
%p
  IDEALS, the Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and
  Scholarship, collects, disseminates, and in some cases publishes research and
  scholarship from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

%ul
  %li
    Faculty, staff, and graduate students can deposit their research and
    scholarship&mdash;unpublished and, in many cases, published&mdash;directly
    into IDEALS. Faculty may use IDEALS to fulfill the
    = link_to("University of Illinois faculty open access policy,", "https://guides.library.illinois.edu/oapolicy/policy")
    and in many cases may use it to fulfill open access requirements from grant
    funding agencies.
  %li
    Departments can use IDEALS to publish or distribute their working papers,
    technical reports, or other research material.
  %li
    IDEALS also includes all
    = link_to("electronic theses and dissertations", collection_path(204))
    deposited from Fall 2010 onward. Many theses and dissertations prior to
    that date have been added to IDEALS but are limited to members of the
    University of Illinois community unless the author has permitted public
    access.
