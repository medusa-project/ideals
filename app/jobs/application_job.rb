##
# Superclass for all jobs with a main purpose of managing an associated {Task}.
#
# # Implementation notes
#
# 1. Implementations must define a `QUEUE` constant with a value of one of the
#    {ApplicationJob::Queue} constant values.
# 2. Implementations' {perform} method must accept a hash argument.
# 3. In their {perform} method, they should update the properties of the {Task}
#    that is passed into them. They shouldn't create their own {Task} because
#    it could lead to multiple tasks being created for the same job.
#
# Implementations should not rescue errors, and should rethrow them if they do.
#
# N.B. when running jobs synchronously, it is important to call
# `MyJob.perform_now` and not `MyJob.new.perform`. The latter will not employ
# any of the mechanics implemented by this class.
#
